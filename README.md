## Extending the flaskTemplate
In this branch of the flaskTemple project I extend the template to build a 3 table application.  During the process I will demonstrate many of the tasks you will need to complete to finish your project.
 
## Changes / additions for this branch
* Demonstrate how to add tables / class defs
* Add 2 new tables - events and attendance
* Clone customer screens for the event screens
* Demonstrate how to do data binding to create a dropdown / list of items from another table. Â 
	* This is important anytime you have a foreign key.
* create a user/customer 'type' attribute which only allows access to certain screens.
